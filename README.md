Guide to Files in this Repo:

Proj.csv <- The cleaned version of the Original DataSet on murders in the US

Tab02.xls <- The Original version of the dataset on the population of each US State. This file had to be manually updated in excel (due to formattting issues), and then saved as a new CSV (which is Pop_data.csv)

Pop_data.csv <-The cleaned version of the Original Dataset on the population of each US State
